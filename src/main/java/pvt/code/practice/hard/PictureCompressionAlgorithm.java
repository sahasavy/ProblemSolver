compression logic:
image, create a tree, enpty node.
divide image into 4 equal quadrants
add 4 children to the tree nodes, balnk nodes
re-divide the 4 quads into 4 more...now 16 quads..
add 4 children again...so totla 16 children...
keep doing it till the squares are of the size 2*2 in the image
add 4 children in the tree

values will be present only in the child node initially... from matrix to ta tree.
next is the compression logic
You

if all 4 nodes have same value, delete those children and put the same value to the parent node of the leaf nodes.
NOTE: values are either 0 or 1

have a method with inputs as 2 trees, and return a final tree

before compression
    N/A                 ||          N/A
N/A     ,   N/A           ||  N/A         ,   N/A
1 1 0 1 , 0 0 0 0       ||  1 1 1 1   , 0 0 0 0

after compression
    N/A                 ||          N/A
N/A     ,   0           ||      1        ,   0
1 1 0 1 ,

//output[i][j] = operator(0, 1)
//output[i][j] = operator(null, 1)//not applicable

FINAL OUTPUT (without compression, based on operator())
    N/A

FINAL OUTPUT (with compression)
